  abstract = {{This book builds theoretical statistics from the first
    principles of probability theory. Starting from the basics
    of probability, the authors develop the theory of
    statistical inference using techniques, definitions, and
    concepts that are statistical and are natural extensions
    and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for
    first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
    students majoring in statistics who have a solid
    mathematics background. It can also be used in a way that
    stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
    being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
    concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
    a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal
    optimality investigations.}},
